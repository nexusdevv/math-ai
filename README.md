## üöÄ About MathAI

MathAI is a powerful web application built with Next.js that allows users to solve a wide range of mathematical problems. Leveraging the powerful WolframAlpha computational engine, MathAI provides detailed step-by-step solutions to help students, educators, and professionals understand the solution process, not just the final answer.

This project was created as a single-developer effort to make advanced mathematical problem-solving more accessible to everyone.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on API Usage

While we strive to provide accurate solutions, please note that:

1. Results from WolframAlpha may occasionally contain errors
2. The free tier of WolframAlpha API has limitations
3. Complex problems may require specialized expertise to verify

Always double-check important solutions against other sources!
